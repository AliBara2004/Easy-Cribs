<!-- Our Approach Section -->

    <h2>Our <span class="highlight">Approach</span></h2>
    <p>We build with precision, agility, and a commitment to quality.</p>
    <div class="approach-description" style="background-image: url('./images/fwehhhhh.jpg');">
        <p>At Easy Cribs, we adopt an agile development process rooted in SCRUM methodology to deliver innovative smart home solutions. Our team works in iterative sprints, typically spanning two weeks, allowing us to adapt quickly to feedback and evolving needs. Each sprint begins with planning, followed by development, testing, and review, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with our mission. We hold weekly meetings with our manager, Kathrin Stark, to gather feedback and determine our next steps moving forward. Additionally, our team collaborates through both in-person and online meetings to maintain strong communication and coordination.</p>
        <p>Our testing plan is comprehensive, combining automated unit tests, integration tests, and manual quality assurance checks. Led by our QA Engineer, Euan Conlon, we rigorously evaluate functionality, performance, and security to guarantee a reliable and seamless user experience. This iterative and thorough approach empowers us to innovate boldly while maintaining the highest standards of excellence.</p>

    <div class="approach-challenges">
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/firebase.jpg');">
            <h3>Firebase Integration Issues</h3>
            <p>We initially planned to use Firebase but faced difficulties integrating it with our existing code. Daniel Fejdych and Mridul Verma switched to a custom backend, ensuring compatibility and control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/graph.jpg');">
            <h3>Graph Display Problems</h3>
            <p>Our graphs were malfunctioning due to missing session data in the database. To solve this problem we updated the schema and graphing logic for accurate visualisations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/graph.jpg');">
            <h3>Meeting Requirement Issues</h3>
            <p>We had problems meeting our key requirements, so we held a meeting to find the best approach. After discussing different strategies, we refined our project plan and assigned clear tasks to ensure alignment with the requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/graph.jpg');">
            <h3>Scope Clarification</h3>
            <p>We had issues with scope, so we scheduled a meeting with Kathrin to ensure we were on the right track. After the discussion, we clarified the project's boundaries and adjusted our deliverables to meet expectations more effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/graph.jpg');">
            <h3>GitHub and Database Access</h3>
            <p>We encountered trouble getting everyone to push and pull on GitHub and access the MariaDB database. To solve this, we provided a walkthrough on Git workflow, helped set up SSH keys, and ensured everyone had the correct database credentials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="challenge-item" style="background-image: url('./images/graph.jpg');">
            <h3>Device Connectivity Issues</h3>
            <p>We faced challenges with ensuring seamless communication between the web app and IoT devices due to inconsistent API responses and network latency. To resolve this, we implemented error handling, introduced message queuing for delayed responses, and optimized API calls for better reliability.</p>
